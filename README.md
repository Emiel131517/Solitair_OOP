Solitair
===

This is a project for school based around object oriented programming (also called `oop`). 
For more information about `oop`: https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP

I am remaking a card game called solitair. There are several version of the game, but i will focus on making the `klondike` version. 

The game is made in the Unity game engine and the coding will be done in c#. 

While i am coding this game i will focus on using `oop` as much as possible. That way the code will be easely reuseble and to keep track of.
